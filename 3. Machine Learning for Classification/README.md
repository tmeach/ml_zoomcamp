### We've completed 2 projects this week:

-**churn_prediction_project.ipynb**

We've been working on Telco Customer Churn Kaggle project. We used Logistic Regression to predict whatever our customers will leave our company or not.

-**binary_classification_homework.ipynb**

We use car's price dataset from Week2 for binary Classification task: based on car's features we've predicted whatever car's price will be above mean price(1) or below (o)
