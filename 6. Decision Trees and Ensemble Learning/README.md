## Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning
This week we covered the following topics:

- Decision trees
- Decision tree learning algorithm
- Decision trees parameter tuning
- Ensemble learning and random forest
- Gradient boosting and XGBoost
- XGBoost parameter tuning
- Selecting the best model

During this week we're working on 2 project - credit risk scoring (credit_scoring_project.ipynb) and house price prediction (California_housing_prices_prediction.ipynb). And of course this week we used Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost for this projects.
