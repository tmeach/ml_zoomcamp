## Deploying Machine Learning Models
This week we covered the following topics:

- 5.2 Saving and loading the model
- 5.3 Web services: introduction to Flask
- 5.4 Serving the churn model with Flask
- 5.5 Python virtual environment: Pipenv
- 5.6 Environment management: Docker
- 5.7 Deployment to the cloud: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (optional)


In the repo code you can find how I deployed ML models using (1) Flask and (2) Docker.
