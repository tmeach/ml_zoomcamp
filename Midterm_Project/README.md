## Midterm Project 

This week we're going to apply everything we've learned so far into practice. We have to complete an end-to-end ML project including model training and deployment. 

In general the project includes the following steps: 
- Description of the project and explanation of how a model could be used. 
- Preparing data, EDA and analyzing important features.
- Training several models, tune their performance and selecting the best one.
- Puting the model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker.
- As a bonus deploying it to the cloud


I'm going to work on the Heart Disease prediction project. It's a binary classification task. The goal is to predict whether a person will develop heart disease based on several lifestyle factors
