## Evaluation Metrics for Classification
This week we covered the following topics:

- 4.1 Evaluation metrics: session overview
- 4.2 Accuracy and dummy model
- 4.3 Confusion table
- 4.4 Precision and Recall
- 4.5 ROC Curves
- 4.6 ROC AUC
- 4.7 Cross-Validation


In the noteboks you can find a solution to a classification task. For evaluation I used metrics such as recall, precision, ROC, ROC AUC. I also used cross-validation and tuned hyperparameters.
